# cs61a

A few of us wanted to actually complete the Homework assignments from the
online python course at https://cs61a.org.  This repo is a place to
post your homework so other can compare solutions and discuss problems.

I propose we use the following directory structure::

  cs61a/HMO1/hw01.ashley.py
            /hw01.drivera.py
            /hw01.xchin.py
       /HMO2/hw02.ashley.py
            /hw02.drivera.py

I'm open to suggestions about structure or anything else you think of.

I created a wiki we can perhaps use to discuss the assignments:
