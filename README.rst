# cs61a

A few of us wanted to actually complete the Homework assignments from the
online python course at https://cs61a.org.  This repo is a place to
post your homework so other can compare solutions and discuss problems.

I propose we use the following directory structure::

  cs61a/ashley/hw01/hw01.py
              /hw02/hw02.py
       /drivera/hw01/hw01.py
               /hw02/hw02.py

I'm open to suggestions about structure or anything else you think of.

I created a wiki we can perhaps use to discuss the assignments:
